- isAdmin? defined in SessionsHelper relies on existence of current_user variable in global namespace ?
	i tried at least to namespace that function to be defined as SessionsHelper.is_admin? but then i don't know
	how to access current_user variable

- [question] - how to properly handle database intergrity issue in a view, let's say workout assigned to nonexistent user
  					 - this is going to fail: @workout.user.email
